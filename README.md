# MPCC
Source code: https://github.com/alexliniger/MPCC This code is based on the original code with some modifications of my own ideas: (1) Linearize the forward Euler method to see the accuracy difference (2) Introduce the obstacle function CBF (3) Change to Yalmip solution (4) Modify the equality constraint and put it into the cost function for solution
